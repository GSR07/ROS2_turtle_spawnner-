# 🐢 Turtlesim Bot in ROS 2 – Exploring Robotics with Python 🤖

Welcome to the **Turtlesim Bot ROS 2** project! This is a hands-on demonstration of robotics development using **Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2)** and the **Turtlesim simulator**, designed to reinforce core ROS concepts through practical coding in Python.

## 📌 Overview

This project was developed to revisit and apply key ROS 2 concepts such as:

- 🔹 **Publishers** – Commanding movement
- 🔹 **Subscribers** – Monitoring the turtle’s pose
- 🔹 **Services & Clients** – Enabling reset and teleportation
- 🔹 **Topics** – Inter-node communication
- 🔹 **Nodes** – Modular functional components

It’s an ideal starting point for those transitioning from ROS basics to structured ROS 2 development.

## 🎯 Key Learnings

- Refreshed and applied theoretical knowledge of ROS 2
- Designed custom ROS 2 nodes in Python
- Implemented **publisher-subscriber** and **client-service** models
- Gained hands-on experience with **message exchange via topics**
- Strengthened understanding of **robotic software architecture**

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

| ROS Concept   | Implementation |
|---------------|----------------|
| Publisher     | Sends velocity commands to move turtle (`/turtle1/cmd_vel`) |
| Subscriber    | Listens to turtle’s pose on `/turtle1/pose` |
| Service/Client| Uses `/clear` and `/teleport_absolute` |
| Topics        | Communicates between controller and turtle |
| Nodes         | Divides logic into clean, manageable components |
